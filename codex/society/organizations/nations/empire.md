                    description: "<p class='text-left'>Humanity in Morning Artifice is subject to the rule of one of four Pravo powers, which are characterized by their overwhelming and increasing use of en-masse social engineering tactics to remain in perpetual power.</p>

<p class='text-left'>The Second Empire of Rus’ is the smallest, least powerful, and least technologically advanced of these nations, but appearances can be deceiving. What they lack in industrial capacity, cyberspace infrastructure, and other practical areas, they compensate for with their ‘progressive’ doctrines and the ability to rapidly implement them, making them surprisingly influential on the world stage.</p>

<p class='text-left'>The meteoric rise of the Empire from a struggling terrestrial civilization to an interstellar powerhouse over the last half century can be attributed to a culture of loyalty and hard work, but the truth is somewhat more nuanced. A breakneck introduction to the society-transforming technology of everyware, combined with an iron-fisted leadership that was willing to bend its definition of ethics to use everyware to its fullest extent, was a likely factor. In any case, today’s Empire is feared, despite the fact that many older people still remember a time when the nation was nothing and have a difficult time recognizing the Empire as a real power.</p>",
