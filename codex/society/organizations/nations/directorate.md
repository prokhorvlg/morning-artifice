                    description: "<p class='text-left'>Humanity in Morning Artifice is subject to the rule of one of four Pravo powers, which are characterized by their overwhelming and increasing use of en-masse social engineering tactics to remain in perpetual power.</p>

<p class='text-left'>The Executive Directorate of the Conglomerate is the world’s leader in number of copyright claims and investments per capita. While boasting the strongest technological and population lead over every other Pravo power in Morning Artifice, the Directorate is also the most volatile; it is lead by a government split between a powerful, infighting Corporate Council and a popular Emperor-King, all in a constant state of conflict with each other. Somehow, despite all  of this, it has persisted in the form of a corporatocracy for the better part of three centuries despite numerous internal and external threats. In fact, it always seems to unite just as something shows up to break it.</p>

<p class='text-left'>Despite all of its ethical shortcomings, the Directorate is, at the very least, an entity that recognizes and accepts that conflict is a natural state of being, as is cooperation between opposing entities with united interests. Directorate philosophy preaches the core concept of the “sun that never rises” - an eloquent way of representing the idea that human nature has always and will always remain the way it is, and that it is vital to accept that mankind will never transcend it. It is this idea that has made the Directorate into the infighting yet powerful entity that it has become over the last three centuries, as there is no shame in greed for money and power; there is only shame in betrayal.</p>",
