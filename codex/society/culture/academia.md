excerpt: "Personal transporters fill a particular kind of niche that often overlaps with local commute systems - used for travelling within neighborhoods, and sometimes between them. They are more common in some places than others, particularly in more 'ubiquitously urban' areas such as space bases - where a charging station can be found anywhere, and public transportation systems replace privately owned commute vehicles."

Unfortunately, personal teleportation hasn't been perfected yet in Unturned Stones so people still rely on practical vehicles.
