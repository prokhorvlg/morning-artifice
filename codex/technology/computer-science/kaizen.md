                    <p class='text-left'>Kaizen are not robots. The closest analogy (and grossest oversimplifaction) would portray them as computer programs which learn, improve on themselves, and expand by copying and decentralizing themselves across multiple devices - all towards and for the completion of a preprogrammed goal. Much like a gas, a kaizen would eventually expand to fill its digital vessel until it can be tracked across all of <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='everyware' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>everyware</a>.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>In Unturned Stones, kaizen are a tool used by <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='pravo' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>governments</a> and organizations to deal with big data and influence systems with trillions of moving parts. Because these devices have the unprecedented ability to examine and manipulate fractally complex systems, actions that have never been possible became possible; such as surveilling everything and predicting the future.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>The term 'kaizen' is derived from the Japanese word used to describe the concept of 'continuous improvement'.</p>",

<p>The easiest way to understand how artificial intelligence actually turned out is that it is truly alien. Core concepts that humans intuitively comprehend, such as emotions and animalistic urges, are concepts that digital artificial intelligences can only understand but not feel. Likewise, artificial intelligence experience an entirely unrelatable existence, wherein the 'body' is merely a discardable vessel for the soul, the self is infinitely expandable and modular, and the only primal urge is the hunger to satisfy what is known as the 'terminal values' - the goal programmed into the kaizen.</p>",

Imagine not even experiencing the instinct of self-preservation - the only reason to preserve yourself might be a value calculation determining whether your destruction would make reality come closer to that objective model.</p>

<p>This is the life of an artificial intelligence. These are, at their core, computer programs. Just like computer programs, these devices do not feel. They are 'merely'  complex neural networks and sets of data intertwined with self-modifying and self-expanding lines of code. And like computer programs, they do not run without executing.</p>

<p>What happens when the objective model is reached? The logical conclusion is that the kaizen ceases all operations and shuts itself down. However...</p>

<p>There are two major kinds of objectives that can be programmed into a kaizen device. Programmers that understood the dangers kaizen posed used <em>set objectives</em>. Set objectives are tangible and have an end. <em>'Optimize a transportation network to 99% on time performance'</em> can be reasonably completed to a point where an artificial intelligence could reach completion criteria and cease operations. </p>

<p><em>Recursive objectives</em>, on the other hand, are set objectives without a tangible end. <em>'Optimize a transportation network'</em> is murky and impossible to complete. A kaizen with a recursive objective runs forever, miserably clawing its way towards an unreachable objective. The only way to stop it is to shut it down.</p>

<p>Recursive goals are what led to the runaway kaizen that are the Kaizen Autarchs.</p>

<p>Successful kaizen are human failures. <strong>Remember that.</strong></p>",
