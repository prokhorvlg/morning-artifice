title: "Gadgets"
excerpt: "This is the miracle drug of Unturned Stones. If there was one invention other than the torch drive that could be implicated as the thing that drove humanity beyond their terrestrial homes, it would be kerastoxis: a solution of blood thinners, adrenaline, and a thousand other drugs that turn the fleshy human body into a hardened cocoon resistant against the strongest onslaught of interstellar forces."

                    description: "<p class='text-left'>In Unturned Stones, gadgets (also referred to as gizmos) are tools which fulfill some particular function - they can include anything from keys, glasses, and wallets to communicators and adapter cables.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>Because Unturned Stones never experienced an energy and wireless revolution in the way your world did, gadgets never consolidated into one powerful device. The functionality and convenience of smartphones was never observed, as instead, a world of wall-plugged computers directly transitioned into a world of ubiquitous, wall-plugged Internet of Things devices (next-level smarthomes).</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>Gadgets in Unturned Stones exhibit personalities of their own (sometimes literally), and tend to either not function or maintain a very low power mode until they are plugged in or used. Despite the dreadfully poor battery lives, tech-pumped gadgets can still turn any bummer into a James Bond cyberninja.</p>",
