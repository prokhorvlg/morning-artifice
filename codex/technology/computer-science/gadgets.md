                    <p class='text-left'>Because the world of Morning Artifice never experienced energy or wireless revolutions, gadgets never quite consolidated into one powerful device. The functionality and convenience of smartphones and similar technology was never observed, as instead, a world of wall-plugged computers directly transitioned into a world of ubiquitous, wall-plugged Internet of Things devices.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>Gadgets exhibit personalities of their own (sometimes literally), and tend to either not function or maintain a very low power mode until they are plugged in or used. Despite the dreadfully poor battery lives, tech-pumped gadgets can still turn any bummer into a 'James Bond cyberninja', as one guest described it.</p>",
