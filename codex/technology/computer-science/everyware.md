title: "Everyware"
excerpt: "Instead of medical development focused on keeping people alive for as long as possible with little regard for whether that life is still worth living, little worth is ever placed on the length of a life. Instead, medical researchers and doctors remain focused on developing ways of improving the quality of the life people already have, since a post-scarcity society limited by its population demands it."

                    description: "<p class='text-left'>The term 'everyware' represents the concept of true technological ubiquity which was achieved in Unturned Stones.</p>

<p class='text-left'>Ubiquity is defined as a 'presence everywhere'. Technological ubiquity is pretty straight-forward - everything was somehow wired into the digital world. From cars, to curtains, to calendars; everything is imbued with a networked microchip.</p>

<p class='text-left'>On it's own, the concept doesn't sound alarming. Of course, the world of Unturned Stones isn't that simple. Combined with powerful kaizen AI which would operate and run across everyware, everyware became the platform that enabled governments, organizations, and even some very exceptional individuals to perform deeds that should never have been possible. Actions like manipulating lives of individual people on an unprecedented scale, and modeling the future from data aggregated from trillions of devices.</p>

<p class='text-left'>Everyware ended up governing the lives of billions of people. Will it govern yours?</p>",
