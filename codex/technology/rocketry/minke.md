Nothing, not even <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='exotic-matter' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>exotic matter</a> ripped straight from black holes, is as precious as a corporation’s data.</p>

<p class='text-left'>Metavaski Applied Technologies is just one of numerous similar organizations and corporations that can be found among the stars. Their mission statement: the secure transport and delivery of information to and from research labs and manufactories.</p>

<p class='text-left'>The Minke, a gargantuan travelling data vault, is their first and only starscraper. Designed to contain valuable blueprints, design specifications, and prototypes for numerous products, it is invulnerable to all but the most brutal and focused of direct assaults due to a battery of low-powered cargo railguns, self-destructing vaults, and <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='bogatyr' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>Bogatyr</a> security forces.</p>

<p class='text-left'>The Minke is also quite capable of spreading spoof data and fake, malicious corporate secrets among a solar system’s UNIT networks. Illegal in most places, but for an exorbidant fee, this secondary service is also provided by Metavaski.</p>"

                    data: "<p>In Unturned Stones, mankind’s interstellar economy runs on information. Nothing, not even exotic matter ripped straight from black holes, is as precious as a corporation’s data.</p>

  <p>But what exactly is corporate data? The vague nature of the term is intentional, but to understand why, you’d have to understand the <strong>Interstellar Information Economy</strong>.</p>

  <p>Corporations (and governments) no longer directly manufacture or implement the products that they design outside of, perhaps, their own home region. Due to the vast distances in space and the tremendous difficulty of shipping interstellar, each system has its own local manufacturer, which in turn license or otherwise make deals for designs created by dedicated design companies in developed systems.</p>

  <p>This leads to a world where there are usually two major entities involved in any manufactured product, whether that’s a starship, home appliance, prefab building, even wireless services and drill bits. There are the <strong>designers</strong> - the groups located in developed locations that handle all things design related, and the <strong>manufactories</strong> - often single-planet companies or local governments that handle the manufacturing of those products within that system.</p>

  <div class='curator'>

    <p>This is why nearly everything in Unturned Stones has two brand names. <!--The distinction is important. For example - Steinbek Inc designed a cool flashlight. They can sell that license to to Volt Electric, who would make it using trusted, refined techniques, and they could sell it to Zhixuan Eastern, a company that uses cheap metals no better than cardboard. You end up with the Steinbek-Volt flashlight, a top tier device, and the Steinbek-Zhixuan flashlight, a hunk of pretty garbage.</p>
    <p>Of course, many designer companies don't license to shit-tier organizations to preserve their brand.. but many also don't.--></p>
  </div>

  <p>The cycle is fairly straightforward. A designer designs a device, ships the blueprint and prototype to extrasolar manufactories, and receives royalties from each one as they manufacture and distribute their product. If a manufactory swindles a designer, all designers stop dealing with that manufactory. This leads to a vulnerability, however - if a designer’s blueprint is leaked, the designer almost always collapses immediately as a company.</p>

  <p>This is where secure data starscrapers come in. These purpose-built behemoths are the futuristic amalgamation of cargo vessels and armored cars, where self-destructing vaults replace cargo containers and servers replace cash. These traveling fortresses, often operated by third party security and technology companies (such as Metavaski in the Minke's case), are virtually impossible to assault - let alone hack or steal from. However, they do become exposed during data transfers…</p>

  <p>Secure data starscrapers move around corporate data. This information, usually considered to be blueprints, design specifications, and prototypes, can also take the form of any sort of data that a corporation considers valuable enough to its operation that they don't want it seen for fear of it impacting their business. This includes research: databases and studies on who and how people use their products; business strategies: future plans for expansion; and other information less conventional.</p>",
