title: "Cybernetic Enhancement"
excerpt: "You may have thought that the future is synonymous with ubiquitous cybernetics. Many science fiction authors in the past have pushed the notion that cybernetics (alternatively, augmentations) were an essential part of transhumanism, and therefore, an inevitability. They could not have been further from the truth."

                    <p class='text-left'>In Unturned Stones, cybernetic enhancement is not widespread. The technology is there; but simply put, no one would ever go out of their way to intentionally recieve one when ubiquitous cybertechnology bears the same effect without the permanent implantation. Those wearing cybernetics do so because they must, such as individuals with a physical or mental trauma wearing prosthetics. Nor are they looked down upon. In some cultures, it is considered to be a symbol of honor.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>Cybernetic enhancements are designed and built on custom order when required, with the major exception of the <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='prosthetic-soul' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>prosthetic soul</a> - a unique case with an unexpected story.</p>",
