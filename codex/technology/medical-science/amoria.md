                    <p class='text-left'>Of course, love isn't as straight-forward as a drug. It is a powerful emotion, driven by a combination of stage-released hormones, psychological states, and a target for affection. However, with the human sciences as advanced as they are, this isn't impossible to achieve artificially. In fact, it is rather formulaic, and treatments of 'love' have begun making the rounds... whether or not subjects are aware of this.</p>",
