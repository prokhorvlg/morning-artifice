title: "Immortality Taboo"
excerpt: "This is the miracle drug of Unturned Stones. If there was one invention other than the torch drive that could be implicated as the thing that drove humanity beyond their terrestrial homes, it would be kerastoxis: a solution of blood thinners, adrenaline, and a thousand other drugs that turn the fleshy human body into a hardened cocoon resistant against the strongest onslaught of interstellar forces."

                    description: "<p class='text-left'>As long as humanity has existed, it had a dream. Whether it persisted through religion, myth, or philosophy; humanity dreamed of the possibility of the impossible. One such impossible dream was immortality. At one point however, society came teetering over the possibility of what was always meant to be impossible.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>Not very long ago, there was a man who sought to make this dream a reality. Jeffrey Quazan, a biotechnology researcher, tried his best. His best was a crowd-funded campaign promising 'aakaash', Hindi for sky. It could have been anything. Perhaps a telomerization procedure, or a mind-uploading system? It really doesn't matter now.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>Only a day before Aakaash was scheduled for release, the world was shivering with anticipation. This was the forefront of the most revolutionary technology since artificial intelligence. Then it didn't come. Society was blindsided. From the resulting fallout, a universal taboo arose that would linger for years on the very thing mankind dreamed of.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>What is the lesson? Never trust Jeff.</p>",
