title: "Local Commute"
excerpt: "Local commute vehicles are a class of transportation devices that you're likely very familiar with. It's hard to strictly define as they encompass anything from trams to cars to rockets, essentially anything that operates in a range that is a bit out of reach for walking but not quite enough to be considered a 'journey'."

Unfortunately, personal teleportation hasn't been perfected yet in Unturned Stones so people still rely on practical vehicles. There are three primary categories that transport devices fall under, barring <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='starscrapers' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>interplanetary spacecraft</a>, which are categorized by their range: <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='personal-transport' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>personal transport</a>, <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='local-commute' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>local commute</a>, and <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='distant-travel' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>distant travel</a>.</p>
