title: "Distant Travel"
excerpt: "At the largest scale of terrestrial transportation, there is the distant travel category. Pretty simple - these take you to distant places using devices like trains, airplanes, ships, rockets. In Unturned Stones, these are highly regional. Each planet and region features a unique challenge that must be overcome with a completely unique transportation solution."

Unfortunately, personal teleportation hasn't been perfected yet in Unturned Stones so people still rely on practical vehicles.
