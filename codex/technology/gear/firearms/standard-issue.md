title: "Standard Firearms"
excerpt: "Standard does not mean 'familiar' or 'contemporary'. Standard firearms are called as such since they are issued as standard equipment to army units, as opposed to covert weapons which are typically employed by spies, and powered weapons which are - much like power tools - used by operation specialists."

                    <p class='text-left'>Standard does not mean 'familiar' or 'contemporary'. Standard firearms are called as such since they are issued as <em>standard equipment</em> to army units, as opposed to covert weapons which are typically employed by spies, and powered weapons which are - much like power tools - used by operation specialists.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>Standard firearms usually take on the form factors that have been traditionally used by armies throughout history, but with major differences with regards to technology and doctrine. For instance, things such as loudness are <em>valued</em> for its psychological impact factor rather than actual tactical effectiveness. For these reasons, while they have extreme destructive potential, they fill a particular niche that is overwhelmingly show-off rather than effective, much like a glamor muscle.</p>",
