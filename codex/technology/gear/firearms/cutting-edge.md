                    description: "<p class='text-left'>Firearms in Unturned Stones can be largely categorized into three groups: <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='standard-firearms' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>standard</a>, <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='covert-firearms' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>covert</a>, and <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='powered-firearms' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>powered</a>.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>Powered firearms are somewhat analagous to power tools in Unturned Stones. These weapons are specialized (besides destructive power, they feature advantageous side effects) and have extreme situational potential - but they must be plugged into the wall to remain operable...</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>As you can imagine, this creates an interesting combat situation, in which these extremely powerful systems can be completely negated by cutting the power cable or shutting off main power. Powered weapons are only practical because most special operations take place in facilities with ubiquitous data and power connections; but without those, they become useless hunks of metal.</p>

                    <p class='text-left'>Usually, powered weapons are utilized by specialists in conjunction with other, more common firearm types during special and black ops scenarios.</p>",
