# Collection page (Exhibition)
title: "Productive Life"
excerpt: "Instead of medical development focused on keeping people alive for as long as possible with little regard for whether that life is still worth living, little worth was ever placed on the length of a life. Instead, medical researchers and doctors remained focused on developing ways of improving the quality of the life people already had, since a post-scarcity society limited by its population demands it."

                    <p class='text-left'>The result is that most people appeared and felt 50 when they dropped dead deep into their 90s. Whether that is a preferable direction to take or not is something you'll have to decide for yourself.</p>",
