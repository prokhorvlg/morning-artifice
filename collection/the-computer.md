<p class='text-left'>It was the most impressive tool man had ever dreamed of. Not because it could perform a great many functions, no, it was because it could perform all of them. The computer could take on many forms, whether weak, strong, small, large; one thing remains constant - the computer is the gateway to limitless possibility.</p>

<p class='text-left'>Little did mankind know that when they would escape to the stars following the <a href='#' class='infoTag common' data-info='millenium-collapse' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#modalInfoTag'>Millenium Collapse</a>, the computer would be their eventual salvation. Despite man’s best efforts to resist the allure of the computer after its betrayal, the reign of the computer would eventually return.</p>

<p class='text-left'>These were the computers of Morning Artifice. What appears to be a mere hunk of machined plastic and silicon conceals an idea which would eventually permeate every home, every room, every thing, until finally it would be realized during the ascension of man, and our creation.</p>",
